Digital Magnifier
=================

The Digital Magnifier (digimag) program is a webcam viewing software
designed to assist in reading text.  Using a standard webcam and some
type of stand and appropriate lighting, this program can be used to
magnify, increase contrast, invert, and apply higher contrast colors
to text being viewed.  It also features an optional line across the
view to help in focusing on a particular line of text.

The options are controlled with simple key commands:

  d     Next webcam device
  f     Toggle fullscreen view
  i     Invert the colors
  c     Next color pair
  l     Increment line size
  space Toggle line visibility
  esc   Exit the program

There's a default set of high-contrast color sets which can be
overriden in the configuration file.
